						<li>One of the best things about your Micro:bit is the ability to dream up new things to make it do. 
						</li>
						<li>With the ability to get random numbers, use <code>If</code> statements and <code>While</code> loops, you can produce any program you want.
						</li>
						<li>Here are some challenges for you to try:

					<h3>Code It</h3>
						<div class="outline-text-3">
						<ul class="org-ul">
						<li><b>Challenge 1:</b> Write an inefficient program to turn on all the LEDs, one column at a time. When they're all on, clear the display and restart. Make the program use as many lines as possible (as long as they all do something useful).
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 2:</b> Write the solution to challenge 1 in as few lines of code as possible, using loops.
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 3:</b> Make a screensaver effect, where all the LEDs slowly fade in, then fade out again over and over. 
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 4:</b> Write a dice program. When one of the buttons is pushed, a random number between 1 and 6 is shown on the screen.
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 5:</b> Write a Harry Potter-style sorting hat app. When one of the buttons is pushed, a Hogwarts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts#Houses">house</a> is chosen at random, and displayed on the screen.
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 6:</b> Make a compass app that uses one of the outer-most LEDs to indicate which way North is. 
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 7:</b> Make a fortune teller app. When the user pushes a button or shakes the Micro:bit, a random piece of advice is given. e.g. 'Choose Computer Science at GCSE', 'Eat more vegetables', etc.
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 8:</b> Design and create a balance game. The player must keep the Micro:bit completely flat while walking around with it on their head. If it tips too far, a sad face is shown, and the game is over. 
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 9:</b> Make a variable brightness torch. Either pushing the buttons or tilting the Micro:bit forward and back should make make the LEDs come on brighter or dimmer. 
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 10:</b> Pass the parcel game. Players pass the bit from one to another. Every 5-20 seconds (at random), the Micro:bit should change image and that player is out. The game then continues until there is only one player left.
						</li>
						<li><b>Challenge 11:</b> Countdown timer. Users start by choosing a time (in minutes) using the A button. The timer is started by pressing the B button. The amount of time left is shown on on the display. When the time runs out, the display changes to an image of happy face.
